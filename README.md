FoodEx
What?
  A mobile application geared for college campuses. Users can:
  Request food and beverages, such as coffee, and arrange a meeting point for delivery. 
  Respond to requests and act as the deliverer. 
Why?
  Users get food/drinks when they would not otherwise have time to get it.  Additionally it is an efficient method for deliverers   to turn their extra meal points into cash.  

Front end iOS Application (for now) and a backend Node.js and MongoDB server utilizing Express and REST API.
